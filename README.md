**For the project :**
Unfortunately, I wanted to host my api on Heroku but have an add-on for mongoDB is too expensive.
The only way to test it is on local via postman.
However images are uploaded on cloudinary through heroku.
I didn't implement the search of the postings by category/location/date.
As i never done javascript before I took a lot of time to implement the rest of the api and I had to start the front end with react nativ.

I learned a lot, even if it was really hard for me, as I never done that kind of programming before.

**modules used :**
npm i --s express body-parser mongoose@5.11.15 nodemon passport passport-http passport-jwt multer cloudinary multer-storage-cloudinary jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
